If your max speed is greater than all the enemies max speed, you may outmaneuver the enemies to gain a bonus to deflection.

Health:
Health =  (6 + (level * 2) + strength)
If strength score is 10 or above -> add level / 2 to health

Max Resource = (level + corresponding ability score) * 10

Resources:
Endurance corresponds to strength and is depleted using combat weapon styles.
Mana corresponds to acuity and is depleted using spells.
Speed corresponds to agility and is depleted using extra attacks (base only 1 extra per round).

Resource recovery - you regain all resources after combat ends

Avoidance - ability to dodge, parry, or move out of a basic attack or style. (level + agility + 4)
Resistance - ability to avoid a spell effect. (level + acuity + 4)
Deflection - ability to mitigate some incoming damage

Basic attack = 2d6 + (main stat - 5) + level
