***IntroStart***
The last thing you remember is being pushed inside a faerie ring in a cave near your home. Your father, Kesk, has long advocated for you as a champion among the Opossums.
You now face a group of flitting faeries flying around and looking upon you warmly. They have soft features and glittered wings that give way to dim light coming from seemingly every direction. There are no shadows cast in this realm.
You're in what seems like a dirt floor arena, surrounded by wild and mystical creatures.
Welcome, young Opossum!
We are the faerie council of the Appalachian Mountains. For too long we've seen your kind play dead to survive in this region. Now, we offer a gift that may allow a resorting of your place in the hierarchy.
